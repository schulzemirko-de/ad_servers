Here I maintain a host file that can be used in various systems such as PiHole.

The file is used in a DNS server (e.g. contained in PiHole) and ensures that the address resolution does not work for certain websites. As a result, a call to the Internet cannot be executed. This means, for example, that adverts from ad servers cannot be reloaded.
